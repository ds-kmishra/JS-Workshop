# Classes
Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. 

Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes.

The body of a class is the part that is in curly brackets {}. This is where you define class members, such as methods or constructor.

The body of a class is executed in strict mode even without the "use strict" directive.

Classes were introduced in ES6.

A class element can be characterized by three aspects:

- Kind: Getter, setter, method, or field
- Location: Static or instance
- Visibility: Public or private

Following is the abstract syntax for the classes in JS:
